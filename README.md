# lib.ie.d.ts
TypeScript library doesn't include IE specific since 1.5 (See https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Breaking-Changes#dom-interface-changes )
This library brings all definitions back.

Roadmap:
* Add missing definitions
* Pull request to DefinitelyTyped
* Pull request to TypeScript
